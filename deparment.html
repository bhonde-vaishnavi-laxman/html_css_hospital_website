        <div class="detalis"> <h1>Ear</h1>
            <pre>
                The ear is a sensory organ responsible for both hearing and balance.
 It's divided into three main parts: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear, each with
 distinct functions in processing sound and maintaining equilibrium. 
Outer Ear: This includes the auricle (the visible part of the ear) and the ear canal. 
The auricle helps collect sound waves, which then travel through
 the ear canal to the eardrum. 


Middle Ear: The middle ear is an air-filled space containing the eardrum and three 
tiny bones (ossicles): the malleus, incus, and stapes. The eardrum vibrates when 
sound waves reach it, and these vibrations are 
 amplified by the ossicles and passed on to the inner ear. 

Inner Ear: The inner ear contains the cochlea, a fluid-filled, snail-shaped 
structure, and the semicircular canals, which are involved in balance. The cochlea 
converts the mechanical vibrations into electrical signals that are sent to the 
brain via the auditory nerve. The semicircular canals detect movement
 and help with balance.
